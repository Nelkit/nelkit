I am a **mobile developer** with over seven years of experience in creating mobile applications, using  **native languages** like **Swift** and **hybrid solutions** like **Flutter** and React Native.

My expertise extends to working with third-party libraries such as Alamofire, RealmDB, and native libraries like CloudKit, UIKit, CoreData, among others. I possess a set of skills that enable me to design a custom user interface using modern techniques like Swift UI, as well as more traditional approaches like Storyboards or UIKit. Additionally, I have extensive knowledge in integrating RESTful APIs and conducting unit testing.

Furthermore, I have ventured into the field of Backend development using Django, as well as Frontend development using technologies like ReactJS. My passion for innovation and new technologies, coupled with my enthusiasm for learning something new every day, makes me an invaluable part of any team seeking creative and innovative solutions.
